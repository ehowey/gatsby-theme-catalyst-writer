# DEPRECIATED - Gatsby Starter Catalyst Writer

**This starter is being depreciated as of gatsby-theme-catalyst v1.0. Instead use gatsby-starter-catalyst-hydrogen. It will continue to work as the package versions are now pinned, you should not have any problems with this in the short-medium term. You should be able to migrate fairly easily to gatsby-starter-catalyst-hydrogen as there were no breaking changes to the data structure for published work. The main change was abstracting the sanity functions into a seperate theme which necessitated a number of changes.**

This is a full-featured starter that ties together the core theme, header and footer themes and the writer theme to ceate a complete website. The theme relies on data from [SANITY.io](https://www.sanity.io/) and includes a customized content studio for the CMS.

## About Gatsby Theme Catalyst

The Catalyst series of themes and starters for [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) were designed to provide an opinoinated set of integrated themes and starters that can be used to accelerate your next Gatsby project. The vision is for one "core" theme in which most dependencies and components are contained followed by progressively more styled and refined child themes and starters. These themes rely heavily on [Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/gatsby/).
